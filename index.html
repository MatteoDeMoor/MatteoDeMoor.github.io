            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>
                Hello, I'm Matteo De Moor, and I'm in my final year of Applied Informatics. 
                I have a strong interest in technology and innovation and am always curious about the latest digital developments. 
                Informatics fascinates me because new possibilities keep emerging, and I love exploring them.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                My studies focus on the exciting world of Artificial Intelligence (AI). 
                I explore machine learning, data analysis, and smart systems, driven by a passion to understand how AI can shape the future of technology. 
                The challenges and opportunities in this field keep me curious and motivated to contribute to the next wave of innovation.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Outside of the digital world, I have a strong interest in staying active and living a healthy lifestyle. 
                Fitness is more than just a routine for me because it’s a passion that balances my studies. 
                Regular exercise helps clear my mind and strengthens qualities like discipline and resilience 
                which are valuable in both my academic and personal life.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I am a big sports fan, both when it comes to playing and watching. 
                Football is definitely my favorite sport, and there’s no doubt that Club Brugge is my number one team. 
                My passion for the club goes beyond just watching their matches, as I’ve also built a collection 
                of Club Brugge shirts over the years. 
                Supporting them is more than just a hobby for me, it’s something I truly enjoy and follow closely.
