                            My sleek Beta 50cc, adorned in a striking white and red color scheme, has been my trusty 
                            companion for almost a year. Its stylish design catches eyes on the road, reflecting my love 
                            for both aesthetics and efficient mobility. With a top speed of 50 km/h, it effortlessly 
                            zips through the urban landscape, making every ride a delightful journey. This small but 
                            mighty machine has truly become an integral part of my daily adventures.

                            In less than a year of ownership, my Beta 50cc has proven to be a reliable and fun 
                            mode of transportation. The dynamic combination of white and red not only adds a 
                            touch of personality but also symbolizes the excitement each ride brings. Cruising 
                            at a steady 50 km/h, it smoothly maneuvers through traffic, offering both speed 
                            and agility. As I navigate the streets on this nimble vehicle, the joy of riding 
                            a 50cc becomes a constant source of exhilaration.

            <h2>Biography Matteo De Moor</h2>
            <p>
                Hello, I'm Matteo De Moor, currently navigating my way through the fascinating realm of informatics as a
                second-year student. My journey in this field is fueled by a profound passion for technology and innovation,
                where I find myself constantly intrigued by the ever-evolving landscape of possibilities that digital
                advancements bring.
            </p>
            <p>
                My academic pursuits are centered around the captivating world of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Exploring the
                depths of machine learning, data analytics, and intelligent systems, I am on a quest to unravel the potential
                of AI to reshape our technological future. The challenges and possibilities in this field ignite my curiosity
                and drive to contribute to the exciting wave of innovation that AI promises.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond the digital realm, I also have a keen interest in maintaining a healthy and active lifestyle. Fitness is
                not just a routine for me; it's a passion that complements my academic endeavors. Engaging in various fitness
                activities not only rejuvenates my mind but also instills discipline and resilience, qualities that prove
                valuable in both academic and personal spheres of life.
